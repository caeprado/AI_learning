Eu demorei mais para fazer o desafio por falta de confiança do que qualquer outra questão, percebi durante o processo que eu realmente não estava preparado para criar um projeto desse, ainda sinto que não estou, mas eu acho que finalizei (não tenho certeza absoluta, sinto que falta algo).\n","###Aprendi muito no proesso e ao finalizar eu percebi que agora eu já sei muito mais do que antes, inclusive eu consigo olhar o código e ver sentido no que fiz. Eu usei como base um código já pronto que estava disponível no próprio site, e como dica do Eduardo eu usei o chatgpt para me dar dicar e melhorar o código. com isso eu consegui finalizar e tanto o código ficou diferente que o valor também foi, ao que eu vejo eu estaria dentro do top20, chegando no objetivo do SNA.\n","###No processo de desenvolvimento tive algumas ideias diferentes do autor para crair um código possivelmente mais preciso, mas ainda não executei. A ideia é separar todas as habilidades exigidas e relacionar as que mais se relacionam com os maiores salários e assim determinar níveis de importância para as habilidades mais exigidas, como sendo uma nova variável. Planejo tentar implementar isso no meu código mas em uma parte separada e não em outro código, conforme eu for tentando que parou para ler isso poderá acompanhar também.\n","###Fora isso, como eu disse agora me sinto mais confiante em pelo menos entender a estrutura de uma modelo de Ml, por isso vou tentar fazer pelo menos 1 projeto por mês que eu encontrar no Kaggle ou mesmo no Machine Hack para seguir treinando e paralelamente começar a aplicar os conhecimentos nas minhas atividades dentro do trabalho."],"metadata":{"id":"vJaXcUJzojiT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Início"],"metadata":{"id":"BgnBRZybfZj1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TEMHKyzbghoS"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import re\n","import nltk\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","data_salary = pd.read_excel('/content/drive/MyDrive/Bases/Hackathon/sample_submission.xlsx')\n","\n","data_test = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Bases/Hackathon/Final_Test_Dataset.csv', sep=\",\")\n","\n","data_train = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Bases/Hackathon/Final_Train_Dataset.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Comentários"],"metadata":{"id":"1G_0MUTAdV--"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###data_test['job_type'].unique() #padronizar a palavra analytics, usar todas em lower\n","\n","###data_test['job_description'].unique() -
